Molecular Dynamics Simulation on Pure and Defect-induced Single Crystalline Tungsten –

Conducted MD simulations of nanoindentation in tungsten single crystals using LAMMPS.
Built a simulation framework for [001]-oriented tungsten with spherical indenters of varying radii and
strain rates and Analysed load–displacement curves to characterize indentation behaviour.
Modeled crystal and irradiation-induced defects to assess their impact on mechanical response.
Derived insights into defect-driven changes in tungsten deformation mechanisms.
Maintained a streamlined workflow integrating defect modeling with mechanical testing simulations.
** Still some unavoidable errors have occured- The load value is much below the predicted data, although the nature of the load displacement curve is precise- working on to provide a corrected code
